# Connect4
Experience an enhanced version of Connect4 with this Python project, where you can challenge an intelligent AI opponent showcasing advanced gameplay without relying on machine learning. The centerpiece is an AI player employing strategic algorithms to analyze the game state, foresee future moves, and make optimal decisions.

# Key Features

- **AI-Powered Gameplay:** The centerpiece of this project is the AI player, which employs a combination of algorithms and strategies to evaluate potential moves, assess game states, and make decisions that maximize its chances of winning. It doesn't just play randomly; it plays smart.

- **Future Prediction:** Unlike a simple rule-based AI, this Connect4 AI has the capability to simulate potential future game states, exploring different scenarios to determine the most advantageous move. By looking ahead, it can anticipate the user's moves and respond strategically.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and interactive. Players can enjoy a seamless gaming experience, with the AI player providing a challenging opponent. The board is visually represented, allowing users to easily track their progress.

- **Customizable Difficulty:** The AI's skill level can be adjusted to cater to both casual players and those seeking a more intense gaming experience. You can fine-tune the difficulty level to suit your preferences (e.g. How many moves the AI can look ahead).

- **Educational and Fun:** This project not only provides entertainment but also serves as an educational tool for those interested in AI and game development. It showcases the potential of AI in gaming and how it can be harnessed to create engaging and strategic gameplay.


# How to Play
To get started, simply clone the repository and run the game. You can play against the AI player and test your skills in a battle of wits. Challenge yourself to think ahead, plan your moves, and outsmart the AI to achieve victory.

# Contributions and Feedback
